<p>I am a recent BE Aerospace graduate from <a href="https://nust.edu.pk/" target="_blank">National University of Sciences and Technology</a>. During my four years I have demonstrated my academic excellence on different levels, most notable of which being the awardee of the: President's Gold Medal, Rector's Gold Medal, and Best Aircraft Design Award. I have a keen interest for robotics and automation and am committed towards fully harnessing the potential of aerial autonomy.</p>

<p>Currently I am working as a Design Engineer - Aircraft Stability and Controls at <a href="https://naqcode.com/" target="_blank">NaqCoDE technologies</a>. Here I work on problems ranging from Flight Dynamics Modelling, Guidance, Navigation, Flight Controls, and Simulations. It is a cognitively stimulating experience where I get to see my Aerospace concepts in action.</p>

<p>As for my commitment towards aerial robotics, I like to undertake projects of autonomous quadcopter flight. Most notable of these has been a solo venture where I designed a controller for a quadcopter, tested it in simulations, and implemented it at a hardware level using a Jetson Nano. The details of this undertaking can be found <a href="{{site.url}}/posts/Navigator" target="_blank">here</a>. This was the first step, taken by me, at my university campus to build towards autonomous agile vision-based quadcopter flight. The idea was to leave behind a solid platform and methodology to be adopted by future researchers to achieve this sophisticated aerial prowess. The hardware aspect of the project is inspired and based off the <a href="https://github.com/uzh-rpg/agilicious" target="_blank">Agilicious</a> platform, an open-source framework provided by <a href="https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/" target="_blank">UZH's Robotics and Perception Group</a>.</p>

<p>I have been part of numerous leadership roles since my senior school years. I successfully lead my school team's programming department in the <a href="https://www.firstlegoleague.org/" target="_blank">First Lego League</a> and <a href="https://first.global/" target="_blank">First Global Challenge</a> to become National Champions and represent Pakistan twice in the USA. As a Sophomore, I lead the Electroadhesion department of team <a href="https://www.instagram.com/saf._.shikan_/" target="_blank">Saf-Shikan</a> in the <a href="http://isssp.bit.edu.cn/en/n12/" target="_blank">International Space Science and Scientific Payload Competition</a>. Last but not the least, I have also served as the President, and formerly also as the Vice President, of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theaviators.nust/" target="_blank">The Aviators</a> society at NUST. I also possess a deep love for sports; especially Tennis, Cricket and Calisthenics.</p>
