<h2>Introduction</h2>

Navigator is the quadcopter of my final year design project. A a solo venture lying at the intersection of modern control theory, flight dynamics modelling, aerial robotics, RC hobby, computer aided design, and design for additive manufacturing. It was a self-crafted research avenue that allowed me to fully experience controller development for aerial vehicles from scratch. It was a challenging and stimulating experience that required a good engineering knowledge from multiple disciplines. This was the first step, taken by me, at my university campus to build towards autonomous agile vision-based quadcopter flight. The idea was to leave behind a solid platform and methodology to be adopted by future researchers to achieve this sophisticated aerial prowess.
